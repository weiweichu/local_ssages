How to use SSAGES with GROMACS
--------------------------------

After compiling GROMACS with SSAGES, you can use all of GROMACS’ available tools to
set up systems and generate input files.  The executable (gmx_mpi) is located in
``ssages/build/gromacs/bin``.

As GROMACS has an in-depth documentation and getting started section, we will not
dwell much on how to use these tools to generate systems. For more information on
Gromacs, read the Gromacs manual
`Getting Started <http://manual.gromacs.org/online/getting_started.html>`_ section
and the official
`Gromacs documentation <http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation>`_.

Briefly, a GROMACS input file (.tpr) requires the following three to generate:

1. A ‘box’ of particles to simulate (``.gro`` file)
2. A topology that describes the forcefield and connectivity (``.top`` file,
   optionally ``.itp`` files)
3. A simulation details file that sets many parameters such as which thermostat
   and barostat to use if any, timesteps, integrator, saving frequency and many
   more (``.mdp`` file)

For example, one can convert a protein ``.pdb`` file from an online database using
GROMACS tools to generate a ``.gro`` and a ``.top`` file. To generate an input
file, use the ``gmx_mpi grompp`` command:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	gmx_mpi grompp -f npt.mdp -p topol.top -c conf.gro -o input.tpr

.. note::

    Note that currently, the ``gmx_mpi`` executable in the SSAGES folder
    will NOT function normally for running regular GROMACS simulations via
    ``gmx_mpi mdrun``.

After an energy minimization and brief NVT and NPT equilibration runs, you should
be ready to use SSAGES with your system. First, generate a ``.json`` for your
SSAGES input. If using a single walker, the “inputfile” should be the same as your
``.tpr`` file name. If using multiple walkers, you should number your input files
right before the extension, include a numberless file, and set the “inputfile” to
be the same as the numberless. For example, if using four walkers, you should set
your “inputfile” to ``input.tpr`` and have the following in your folder:

* ``input.tpr`` 
* ``input0.tpr`` 
* ``input1.tpr`` 
* ``input2.tpr``
* ``input3.tpr``

The numberless ``input.tpr`` will not be used. Then, for each walker, set the “type”
to “Gromacs”, and define the number of MPI walkers to use for each walker with
“number processors”. Finally, define your CV(s) and Methods, either generally or
for each walker. You can start your simulation by calling the ssages executable:

.. code-block:: bash

	mpirun -np X ./ssages input.json

where `X` is the total number of MPI processes. For example, for three walkers with
``“number processors” : 2``,  :math:`X = 3*2 = 6`.

Normally, you can also define an observer in ``.json`` to automatically generate
backups that will save both simulation snapshots as well as method-critical data.
However, this feature is not yet implemented for GROMACS.

There are example ``.gro``, ``.mdp``, ``.top``, ``.tpr`` and ``.json`` inputs
available in the Examples folder.
