Swarm of Trajectories
---------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like all string methods in general, the **string method with swarms of
trajectories** (often abbreviated to "swarm of trajectories" or even more simply
"SoT") is a method to identify a transition pathway in an arbitrarily
high-dimensional collective variable space between two metastable states of a
system.  This pathway (the string) is a parametrized curve discretized into a
set of images, each of which is itself a molecular system.  The classical *string
method in collective variables* evolves each image by estimating a mean force and
metric tensor at each image with restrained molecular dynamics simulations.  In
the SoT method, the string is instead evolved by launching a large number (a
swarm) of **unrestrained** trajectories from each image and estimating the average
drift of the collective variables over the swarm.  

The mathematical background of the method can be expressed in a few relatively
straightforward equations, with further detail available in the original work of
Benoit Roux and collaborators [1]_.  First, consider a path :math:`z(\alpha)`
constructed between two metastable states, such that :math:`\alpha=0` represents
the starting state and :math:`\alpha=1` is the final state.  The "most probable
transition pathway" (MPTP) is defined such that a molecular system started from
anywhere on the path will most probably evolve while staying on the path.  It is
shown in the original work that a mathematical definition for such a path is
given when the collective variables evolve according to:

.. math::

    z_{i}(\alpha) = z_{i}(\alpha') + \sum\limits_{j}\left(
    \beta D_{ij}\left[ z(0) \right] F_{j}\left[z(0)\right] +
    \frac{\partial}{\partial z_{j}}\left( D_{ij}\left[z(0)\right]\right)
    \right)\delta\tau

Where the following notation is used: :math:`z_{i}` represents the collective
variables belonging to the string, :math:`\alpha` represents the parameter
identifying that point on the string, :math:`\beta` represents the temperature,
:math:`D_{ij}` represents the diffusion tensor, :math:`F_{j}` represents the
mean force, :math:`z` represents the collective variables constructed from the
molecular system at a given moment in time, and :math:`\delta\tau` represents
the time step of the evolution of the dynamics.  The SoT method approximates
this equation using the average drift evaluated from a large number of unbiased
trajectories, each of length :math:`\delta\tau`, launched from each image:

.. math::

    \bar{\Delta z_{i}(\delta\tau)} = \bar{z_{i}(\delta\tau) - z_{i}(0)} \equiv
    \sum\limits_{j} \left( \beta D_{ij}\left[z(0)\right] F_{j}\left[z(0)]\right] +
    \frac{\partial}{\partial z_{j}}\left( D_{ij}\left[ z(0)\right]\right)\right)\delta\tau

Like all string methods, there is an additional step beyond evolving the
collective variables - after one iteration of evolution, the images along the
path must be reparametrized such that they lie (for example) an equal arc length
apart.  This step is necessary to ensure that all images do not fall into one
metastable basin or the other.

Algorithmically, the SoT method is implemented as follows:

1. An initial string is defined between the two states of interest.  This can be
   defined however one wishes; often it is simply a linear interpolation through
   the space of the collective variables.  In fact, the ends of the string need
   not necessarily be in the basins of interest; the dynamic nature of the
   method should allow the ends to naturally fall into nearby metastable basins.

2. For each image of the string, a molecular system with atomic coordinates that
   roughly correspond to the collective variables of that image is constructed.

3. A set of equilibrium trajectories are generated from that system by performing
   restrained sampling around the image’s collective variables. 

4. That set of equilibrium trajectories is used as the starting point of a large
   number of short unbiased trajectories; the resulting average displacement of
   each collective variable is used to update the positions of the images.

5. A reparameterization scheme is enforced to ensure that, for example, the
   string images are equally distant in collective variable space.

Steps two through five are iterated upon, leading to convergence of the method
and the MPTP. 

Options & Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To construct a Swarm input file, the following options ae available. A
complete Swarm JSON file will inherit some of its inputs from the String
schema (for parameters common to all string methods) as well as the
Observer schema (for restarts). The options unique to Swarm are:

initial_steps
    For each iteration of the method, this is the number of steps to spend
    doing restrained sampling and not harvesting trajectories. This time is
    important to ensure the underlying molecular system’s CV values are
    close to the string CV values.

harvest_length
   After the initial restraining is finished, a trajectory is harvested for later use in launching an unrestrained trajectory every so often - harvest length specifies how often this will be done. Harvest length multiplied by number of trajectories (see below) will determine overall how many more steps will be taken under restrained sampling.
 
number_of_trajectories
   The total number of unrestrained trajectories to be included in each swarm.
   
swarm_length
   The length of each unrestrained trajectory in the swarm. Swarm length multiplied by number of trajectories specifies how many total steps will be spent doing unrestrained sampling. 

From the String schema, the options are:

type
    This parameter identifies that a String-type method is being used, and
    thus should be set to “String”

flavor
    This parameter identifies the specific kind of string-type method
    being used; for swarm, it should be set to “Swarm”.

centers
    The initial values of each CV for each image on the string are specified
    under "centers", which is an array of size equal to the total number of
    images, with each entry consisting of an array with size equal to the
    number of CVs used for the string method. In this way, the initial string
    is defined.

tolerance
    This is a tolerance threshold that can be set to trigger the end of
    the method; it is a percentage by which, if no node CV changes by this
    percentage, the method will end. It must be specified as an array with
    one entry for each CV desired.

max_iterations
    A complementary stopping criterion can be specified; the method will
    stop if it undergoes this many iterations of the string method.

ksprings
    A unique spring constant must be defined for each CV; its purpose is
    described above.

frequency
    The frequency of each integration step. This should almost always be
    set to 1.

Tutorial
^^^^^^^^

This tutorial will walk you step by step through the user example provided with
the SSAGES source code that runs the SoT method on the alanine dipeptide using
LAMMPS.  First, be sure you have compiled SSAGES with LAMMPS.  Then, navigate to
the ``SSAGES/Examples/User/Swarm/ADP`` subdirectory.  Now, take a moment to
observe the ``in.ADP_Test and data.input`` files.  In general, these should be
the same as what you would use for any other method, but for the SoT method, it
is important to define a larger skin distance than one normally would in the
neighbor command in LAMMPS.  This is because, under the hood, each unrestrained
trajectory in the swarm is started by manually resetting the positions of each
atom in the LAMMPS simulation to the start of a new trajectory.  From the
perspective of LAMMPS, this is a huge amount of distance to move in a single
time step; this move triggers neighbor list rebuilding, but LAMMPS considers it
a "dangerous build" which threatens to crash the simulation.  Thus, we increase
the skin distance, which forces LAMMPS to keep track of more pairs in the
neighbor lists, and thus reduces the number of dangerous builds.  Keep this in
mind for future runs of the SoT method.

The next two files of interest are the ``Template_Input.json`` input file and
the ``Input_Generator.py`` script.  Both of these files can be modified in your
text editor of choice to customize the inputs, but for this tutorial, simply
observe them and leave them be.  ``Template_Input.json`` contains all the
information necessary to fully specify one driver; ``Input_Generator.py`` copies
this information a number of times specified within the script (for this
tutorial, 22 times) while also linearly interpolating through the start and end
states defined in the script and substituting the correct values into the
"centers" portion of the method definition.  Execute this script as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    python Input_Generator.py

You will produce a file called ``Swarm.json``.  You can also open this file to
verify for yourself that the script did what it was supposed to do.  Now, with
your JSON input and your SSAGES binary, you have everything you need to perform
a simulation.  Simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    mpiexec -np 22 ./ssages Swarm.json

Soon, the simulation will produce a ``node-X.log`` file for each driver, where
X is the number specifying the driver (in this case, 0-21 for our 22 drivers).
Each one will report the following information, in order: the node number, the
iteration number, and for each CV, the current value of the string CV as well as
the current value of the CV calculated from the molecular system.  

Allow your system to run for the desired number of MD steps, but keep an eye on
it - the system should exit once one driver reaches the maximum number of MD
steps, but it is possible that instead one driver will exit and the rest will
get stuck.  Check in on your node files and see if they’ve been updated recently - if
not, the simulation has likely finished.  Once this is done, you can execute the
included plotter.py function in a directory containing the node files with the
command line argument of how many images your string had.  The script also
accepts an argument to plot a free energy surface alongside the string, but that
goes beyond the scope of this tutorial.  Thus, simply execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    python plotter.py 22 none

And in a moment you should have a graph of your converged string.  Thus concludes
this tutorial.
