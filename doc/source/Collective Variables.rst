Collective Variables
====================

Collective variables (CVs) are arbitrary differentiable functions of the 3N Cartesian 
coordinates of the atoms in a simulation. They usually represent some chemically 
meaningful pathway along which advanced sampling can be performed. Listed below 
are the collective variables currently supported in SSAGES. In addition to 
specific properties for each CV, a name property can be defined for any CV 
which can be used to reference the CV from a method or other supported location. 

.. code-block:: javascript

	"name" : "mycvname"

Specified names for CVs must be unique. It is possible to omit a name and reference 
a CV by its index as well.

	}

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This CV calculates alpha helix character by comparision to an "ideal" alpha
helix structure composed of 6 amino acids. This is computed by performing a

where :math:`r_i` is the pairwise RMSD calculated between the backbone atoms in
the 6 amino acid sequence and the ideal reference structure. 5 backbone atoms
are used for each amino acid, so each pairwise RMSD is calculated between two
sets of 30 atoms. In the case of glycine, the HA1 atom is used in place of CB
backbone atom.

.. note::

	Note that this CV is basically a summation of a switching function; in the
	future the user will be able to choose custom parameters for the switching
	function.

to separate chains. For example, if your system has two chains of 20 amino acids
each, the first amino acid in the second chain should be numbered 21.

    "unitconv"

Property ``unitconv`` must be numeric. This factor is used to reconcile the
internal MD units for your engine and the units used in the ideal alpha helix
